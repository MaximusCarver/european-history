				Findings of modern humans in Spain date back 35,000 years. The Iberian Peninsula was occupied by many different cultures. The Phoenicians arrived in the 9th century BC, followed by the Greeks, then the Carthaginians until the Romans arrived in 200 BC. At the end of the Roman Empire, the Visigoths took over the land until the Islamic Moors arrived from Northern Africa in the 8th century AD, and controlled the area for several hundred years. The Moors left a small pocket of Christians near the Pyrenées out of the Muslim rule. Over the
course for 700 years, this small pocket of Christians grew into small Kingdoms, and expanded South. In 1479 the Kingdom of Spain was formed when Isabel and Ferdinand became King and Queen of Spain by uniting two Kingdoms.

				In the 1500s, during the Age of Exploration, Spain became the most powerful country in the world. Spanish conquistadores Hernan Cortes and Francisco Pizarro conquered most of the Americas and claimed them for Spain. Continued wars started the decline of Spain. In 1800s most of Spains colonies started to revolt against Spain and separated. In 1898 after losing the Spanish-American war, they lost many of the colonies in the Americas. In 1936 Spain had a civil war, which was won by General Francisco Franco who ruled the country until 1975 as a dictator. Spain was not in World War II, but somewhat tied to Germany which created some issues for Spain later on. In 1976 constitutional democracy was established in Spain in the form of parliamentary constitutional monarchy, with the King as head of state. Today Spain is a major developed country with a high income economy. It is a member of the European Union, and the Schengen Area.

				The Running of the Bulls, held in the city of Pamplona every July since 1385 is one of the oldest and most dangerous traditions. During the event, six bulls chase mozos (a group of young men) who traditionally wear white with a red
sash while running around the city streets trying not to get trampled. The origin of the event started in the 14th century when the bulls had to be transported to the markets to be sold. Men had to use tactics like scaring or exciting the cattle to make them go to their destination faster. During this transport some young men would get in front of the bulls and run until they got to their pens. In time this “transport of the bulls” became an event with spectators.
