				The Republic of France is a country located in western Europe, and is surrounded by the Mediterranean, the English Channel, and the North Sea. The earliest findings of human life on this land goes back 1.8 million years. It was around the year 7,000 BC that inhabitants were able to settle down in what is now known as France. During the Iron Age, France was inhabited by the Celtic people. In the year 52 BC, Rome annexed France and occupied it until 476 AD, at which time the Germanic Franks created the Kingdom of Francia. In 843 AD, Francia was divided into Western Francia, Middle Francia and Eastern Francia. Western Francia, which became Kingdom of France, eventually became the largest cultural and economic power of Europe.

				French culture flourished during the Renaissance between the 15th and 17th centuries. In the 18th century, the French Revolution resulted in the monarch being overthrown. In the 19th
century, Napoleon established the First Empire. After the Napoleonic Wars, the empire collapsed and the second and eventually the Third Empires were established. During the second World War, France was occupied by the Axis powers, after which the Third and then Fourth Republics were overthrown. Finally, in 1958, the Fifth Republic was formed by Charles De Gaulle which remains today.

				Mont Saint Michel, an abbey built over 1300 years ago in Normandy (north western France), used to be only accessible during low tides. Because most attackers ended up drowning, the Island remained unconquered during the Hundred Years’ War. Louis XI in the 14th century turned the abbey into a prison, realizing the benefits of its isolation during high tides. It remained a prison
throughout much of the ancient regime. Since a new bridge was built to the island in 2014, it has become a much more visited tourist spot.
