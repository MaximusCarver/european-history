				By the end of the 15th century Hungary was occupied by the Ottoman Empire and stayed under their control until the Habsburg rule took over the land in the 18th century, later becoming a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. With Austro-Hungarian Empire collapse after World War I, Hungary lost 70% of its territory and people. Hungary joined the Axis powers in World War II and after their defeat became a satellite state for the
Soviet Union. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1989 Hungary became a democratic parliamentary republic.

				Attila the Hun was a ruthless warrior, and a barbaric ruler of the Huns from 434 to 453. During his reign he was one of the most feared enemies of the Roman Empire. He was said to have died in his sleep choking on his own blood during a nose bleed. However, there are no clear accounts of this, so nobody knowns how he really died. He was 46 years old.
