				The earliest archeological findings in Italy dates back to 850,000 years, while modern Humans appeared in Italy about 40,000 years ago. The main first people of Italy were Greeks in the 8th century BC. Then came the Phoenicians and Carthaginians. The Greek influence in the Italic tribe, known as the Latins, formed the Roman Kingdom in 8th century BC in the west coast of Italy. The Roman Kingdom eventually conquered and expanded throughout Europe, North Africa, and Asia, and by the 1st century BC, became a Republic, later became an Empire. In 395 AD the Roman Empire split into two the Western and Eastern
Roman Empire. The Western Empire was ruled in Rome. The Western Empire fell in 476.

				Italy was finally united in 1861 as the Kingdom of Italy. Between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, northern Italy became industrialized, while southern Italy became impoverished. This led to a diaspora, a large scale exodus of Italians from Italy. Despite being one of the winning forces of the first World War, Italy was taken over by the Italian Fascist dictatorship. Italy’s defeat in the second World War alongside the axis powers also ended The Italian Civil war against the fascist regime, establishing the Italian Republic.
