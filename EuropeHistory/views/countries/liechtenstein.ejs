The Principality of Liechtenstein is an Alpine micro state in Central Europe bordered by Switzerland and Austria. The first farming settlements in this area go back to 5300 BC. During the 1st century BC, Liechtenstein was inhabited by the Helvetii, who were later conquered by the Roman Empire headed by Julius Caesar. They remained in the Roman Empire until the Frankish Empire invaded in the 6th century A.D. Eventually becoming a part of the Holy Roman Empire, the main language in Liechtenstein was Romansch until the Alemannic tribes took over the region. In the early 1700s, Austrian Prince Johann Adams von Liechtenstein I bought the area and named it after himself.

				Liechtenstein is one of few countries in the world to not have a military, and follows a neutral position during wars. In 1868, during Liechtensteinâ€™s last military involvement, 80 soldiers were sent to Italy to fight. They came back with 81 soldiers - one Italian soldier who wanted to live in Liechtenstein returned with them. After that, the army was dissolved.

				Barbara Erni was a Liechtenstein(ian) woman who traveled throughout Europe with a large treasure chest in the 17th century. Every place she stayed at, she asked her treasure chest to be kept in the best and most secure room available.
A small man, her accomplice, was apparently in the chest. He would come out at night and steal all the valuables located in the room. Barbara Erni made a good living for many years doing this trick until one day she was caught and beheaded in 1785. She was the last person to be executed in Liechtenstein.
