				United Kingdom or Britain is a collection of four countries in Western Europe bordering Republic of Ireland. The countries that make up United Kingdom are England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. During 6000 BC, the water levels retrieved and the British Isles were formed separating from mainland Europe. Around 600 BC the Celtic people began to arrive in the area. In 55 BC Roman Emperor Julius Caesar invaded Britain and founded the city of Londinium (which eventually became London). After four centuries of ruling, the Romans started to retrieve and in 450 Anglo-Saxons moved into the area. In 878, with Alfred the Great as their King, the Anglo-Saxons defeated the Vikings who had been trying to settle in the land. However, Anglo-Saxons were eventually defeated during the Norman Conquest in 1066, and their leader
   
William was crowned king of England. With the Norman Conquest the 600 year Anglo-Saxon rule had come to an end and the new era of Norman rule started in Britain.

				In 1282 the English conquered Wales and the king’s son was made Prince of Wales. The next two hundred years were full of difficult times. The start of the Hundred Years’ Wars against France, the massive loss of lives of Black Death and the War of the Roses all occurred between the years 1300s to 1500s.
The Hundred Years’ War was fought because King Edward III believed he had a right to the throne of France because of his mother Isabel. Even though the conflict lasted over a hundred years, there were many peaceful times in between. The French did not accept the English rule, and Joan of Arc’s heroism pushed many French to resist the English even more, eventually pushing them out of Bordeaux and ending the Hundred Years War.
In 1455 after the end of the Hundred Years’ War, the War of the Roses began. This was a feud between two families (Lancastrians and York) for the right to rule England. It was called the War of the Roses because of the badges of the both families were roses. House of Lancaster was represented by a red rose, House of York was represented by a white rose. Both of the families claimed the right to rule because they were both from the linage of King Edward III. Eventually York
family took over the throne, however shortly after were defeated by Henry Tudor who became the King and ended the War of the Roses in 1485.
In 1536 England and Wales officially united by the Act of Union. In 1707 England and Scotland were united as one country called Great Britain. In 1801 the British and Irish parliaments are joined by the Act of Union to create the United Kingdom. In 1805 the United Kingdom defeated Napoleon in Battle of Trafalgar and became a super power in Europe.

				In the town of Ballymoney there is a road called the Dark Hedges. It is a road surrounded by nearly 300 year old beech trees. The trees were planted by James Stuart the owner of the land in 1743, and the mansion on the nearby property GraceHill.

The road of these massive trees is supposed to be haunted by a “Gray Lady” ghost who appears to travelers at dusk.

				There have been many influential English writers, but the most widely known one is William Shakespeare (1564-1616). Shakespeare wrote 39 plays and 154 sonnets. His early works are comedies like The Taming of the Shrew and Midsummer Night’s Dream, and historical dramas like Richard III and Henry VI. His later works were tragedies like Romeo and Juliet, and Hamlet. Although Shakespeare wasn’t respected a lot in his lifetime, he did receive some praise for his works. After his death, two of his friends gathered most of his works into a book called First Folio and published it.

				Henry VIII was a king of England between 1509-47. He was known for drastic changes to the English Constitution during his reign. He was also known as the Father of the Royal Navy. However, he was most famous for his six wives. In fact
his decision to annul his first marriage led eventually to the English Reformation. He separated the Church of England from papal authority by dissolving all covenants and monasteries and declaring himself the Head of Church of England. He was regarded as one of the most charismatic of the English rulers. He died at a rather young age of 55 due to complications from his excessive weight.
