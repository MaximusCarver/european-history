				The inhabitants of the Netherlands go back 250,000 years. In Iron Age Celtic tribes were most prominent in this area. In more modern times, Julius Caesar in 57 BC conquered this land and added it to the Roman Empire. During Roman times, the Frisian Tribes moved into the area and spread the Frisian language. After Roman decent, the area was conquered by Charlemagne and the Netherlands was added to the Holy Roman Empire. Between 800-1000 AD the Vikings arrived. Later the land became a part of the Habsburg Empire. After the Habsburg Empire was taken over by the Spanish King, the Dutch revolted, led
by William of Orange, and won their independence from the Spanish in 1581. Napoleon briefly took over Netherlands in 1806, but after his defeat the Netherlands gained their independency and established United Kingdom of Netherlands with Belgium in tow. Belgium later on gained its own independence. During World War I Netherlands remained neutral. However, during World War II Germany occupied Netherlands and gathered all the jewish people and sent them to concentration camps. After the War Netherlands joined the NATO and ended their neutrality.

The Netherlands means “the lower countries”. The term “low country” was established centuries ago to indicate its geographical structure of being lower than the sea level and being consisted of mostly flat lands. Geologically the western Netherlands is a deltaic sediment formed by the rivers of Rhine and Muse as well as the North Sea. The land was made habitable by human intervention of filling in the water lands. Due to its make up, the land of the Netherlands periodically gets flooded by the North Sea. The worst flood was in 1287 killing 50,000 people. The latest flood in 1953 killed 1,800 people forcing
the government to launch project “Delta Works” to protect the country from future floods.

				More than 75% of the 140,000 Jewish people in the Netherlands were sent to concentration camps to their deaths during the Nazi occupation in World War II. Anne Frank was a German jewish teenager whose family had relocated to Amsterdam just before the World War. As the Nazis were gathering all the jews in Amsterdam, Anne and her family hid inside their house. That is where she wrote her diary detailing her life in hiding from the Nazis. Her family’s home is now a museum in Amsterdam.
