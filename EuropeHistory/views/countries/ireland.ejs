				Republic of Ireland is a country on an island NorthWest of Europe. The only border it shares is with Northern Ireland to its north. Ireland was inhabited by the Celtic tribes in the 5th century BCE. The Celts ran Ireland in small kingdoms for the next millennia. In 432 AD Saint Patrick arrived in the area. Saint Patrick was a Roman-British missionary who brought Christianity to the Celts living in
 
Ireland. He helped convert the local Celts into Christianity. Creation of Monasteries during this time helped scholars gain and keep the knowledge of Latin and Greek as well as metal works. In 795 the Vikings invaded Ireland attacking monasteries and towns. The Vikings stayed for over a couple of hundred years until the Normans arrived in the 12th century. In 1171 King Henry II of England claimed Ireland as a part of his empire. Even though Ireland was dominated by England for the next few hundred years, they rebelled and fought against it many times with the help of the Scottish and then with the help of the French. Finally in 1800 Ireland officially became a part of United Kingdom.

				In 1919 the Irish rebels called the Sinn Fein declared independence from England and thus causing separation from Northern Ireland following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The treaty caused a divide between the old IRA (Irish Republican Army) members. This led to a civil war between pro-treaty supporters and anti-treaty supporters. The war and its outcome caused a deep divide in Ireland and the two political parties Fine Gael and Fianna Fail in Republic of Ireland are direct descendants of the opposing sides of the civil war. After the civil war the independent state was eventually declared a free republic.

				Geographically Ireland is covered by water with North Sea to the North, the Irish Sea to the East, the Atlantic Ocean to the West, and the Celtic Sea to the South. Western Ireland is more rugged terrain than the east. The highest mountain is Carrauntoohil at 1000 meters (3400 feet) high. There are many lakes and rivers in the lowlands in Ireland, the longest river is the River Shannon. Ireland is the least forested country in all of Europe because of clearing all the trees to make space for crop lands. The climate in Ireland is mild and wet. The winters are mild, summers are cool, over cast and rainy more than half of the year.

				Shamrock, a three leaved clover, is a symbol of the “luck of the Irish”. It was first used by Saint Patrick to teach people about the Christian Holy Trinity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It was later taken up by rival militias during 18th century political unrests. During the 19th and 20th century the use of the shamrock became more frequent eventually leading to world wide association with the Irish culture.
