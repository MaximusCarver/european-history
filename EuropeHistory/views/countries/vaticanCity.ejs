				Vatican City is a city-state that is on an area in Rome, Italy on less than 0.2 (0.5km sq) square miles of land and has 800 residents. Vatican City became independent from Italy with the Lateran Treaty in 1929. It is a distinct territory with full authority and jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome known as the the Holy See.

				From 8th century to 18th century Italy was divided into Papal States, and was ruled by the Catholic church. The Pope that ruled the states did not live in Vatican, but lived in Lateran Palace in South Rome. But around 16th century they moved to Quirinal Palace in Rome. After the unification of Italy in 1870, the King of Italy took over the Quirinal Palace, and the popes were moved to Vatican. They resided there undisturbed with many papal prerogatives. However, the popes did not recognize the Italian King’s right to rule Rome, and refused to leave Vatican compound until an agreement was reached. The last papal ruler Pope Pius IX was considered a “prisoner in the Vatican” before the Lateran Treaty was signed. The Lateran Treaty was finally signed in 1929 between Pope Pius IX and Benito Mussolini establishing the independent state of Vatican City.
 
During World War II Vatican City was left unharmed, even though surrounding areas in Rome was bombed.

The Vatican has no military defense of its own, however military defense is provided by the Italian Armed Forces. Also, the Holy See provides the Pontifical Swiss Guard as an honor guard to protect the pope.
