				The Swiss Confederation is a land locked country in central western Europe. It is comprised of 26 cantons with its federal base located in Bern. The oldest hominid findings in Switzerland can be traced back 150,000 years ago. The earliest farming findings go back to 5,300 BC. The earliest cultural tribes in Switzerland were the Helvetii, who were part of the Celtic tribes. They occupied the land until they were conquered by the Roman Empire in 15 BC. The Romans held dominion over Switzerland for the next 500 years, in which time Switzerland flourished. In the year 800 A.D, Charlemagne, the King of the Franks, took over Switzerland in which it became a part of the Holy Roman Empire until 1291. But it wasn’t until 1499 that Switzerland was officially given independence. Since the 16th century, Switzerland has maintained a strong policy of armed neutrality and hasn’t fought in an international war since 1815, even throughout both World Wars and the Cold War.

				Today, Switzerland is one of the most developed countries in the world with the highest wealth per capita. Switzerland's cities offer one of the highest ranked
 
quality of life to its residents, as well as attract many multi national organizations. Zurich is the head quarters of FIFA, the Bank for International Settlements is located in Basel, and Geneva has the UN’s second headquarters and is the birthplace of the Red Cross.

				Geographically, Switzerland is divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura Mountains. While the Alps take up 60% of the country’s land, most cities and inhabitants are located around the Swiss Plateau even though the plateau is considered --(very)-- hilly. There are many glaciers in the valleys of the Swiss Alps that eventually lead to rivers like the Rhine and Rhône. There are also 1500 lakes in Switzerland. Some of the largest ones are Lake Geneva, Lake Constance, and Lake Maggiore. Between the 48 mountains located in Switzerland, Monte Rosa is the highest, and Matterhorn is the most famous for its distinctive mountain peak as well as its often fatal attraction to climbers.

The climate differs between areas in Switzerland from glacial conditions to pleasant Mediterranean temperatures. The climate in the Alps' lower altitude regions tend to have dry winters, while higher altitudes recieve more rain.
    
However, the weather patterns in Switzerland tend to be unstable and differ from year to year.

				Located deep underground in Switzerland is a 17 mile-long tunnel and a mega machine called the Large Hadron Collider. It has been designed to conduct tests to recreate and reveal the conditions that existed immediately following the Big Bang, which created the universe 13.7 billion years ago. Beams of Protons (subatomic particles found in the nucleus of an atom) are sent around the tunnel at 99.9 % the speed of light before colliding with one another, creating temperatures 100,000 times hotter than the sun.
