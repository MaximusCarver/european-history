				The Kingdom of Belgium is a country in Western Europe bordered by Netherlands, France, Luxembourg and Germany. Belgium gets its name from the original inhabitants the Belgae who were a part of the Celtic tribes. The Belgae was conquered by the Roman Empire in 100 BC and stayed in their rule for the next 300 years. When the Roman Empire started to fall, Germanic tribes took over the land. For the next several centuries many different empires and dynasties ruled over Belgium. In the 17th century they were ruled by the Spanish and the Austrian Habsburgs. In 1795 Belgium became a part of France during
   
the Napoleonic Wars. After Napoleon’s defeat it was invaded by the Dutch. In 1830 they gained their independence from the Dutch and the Belgian King Leopold II was given a part of Congo. During World Wars II, Belgium was invaded by Germany. After Allies liberated Belgium from Germany in 1945, Belgians abdicated King Leopold III for his collaboration with the Germans as well as the atrocities that had happened to Congo during his family’s rule.

Today Belgium has a parliamentary system with constitutional monarchy. It is divided into three highly autonomous regions: the Flemish Region in the North, Wallonia in the South, and the Brussels Capital Region. The Flemish Region speaks mostly Dutch, the rest of the country speaks French with a small section speaking German. In the 20th century there have been many tensions between the Flemish speaking Region and the French speaking citizens fueled by language and cultural differences as well as employment opportunities that led to many reforms.
